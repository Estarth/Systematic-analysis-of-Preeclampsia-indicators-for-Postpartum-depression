# Systematic-analysis-of-Preeclampsia-indicators-for-Postpartum-depression
Developed a machine learning model for the early detection of Postpartum Depression (PPD) utilizing the PRAMS dataset (2012â€“2020). The project identified pre-eclampsia as a significant predictor and explored demographic, behavioral, and medical factors to enhance prediction accuracy. Implemented and compared algorithms including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest and many more models to identify the optimal approach for classification. Conducted extensive feature engineering, data balancing, and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance. Achieved high accuracy and robustness in early PPD prediction, with potential applications in targeted healthcare interventions and maternal mental health screening programs.
